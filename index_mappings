Three main components of an index are aliases , mappings and settings

PUT sample_1
{
  "aliases": {
    "NAME": {}
  },
  "mappings": {
    
  },
  "settings": {
    
  }
}

Difference between keywords and text.Both are string fields.
text is an analyzed fields , it is broken down into multiple tokens using an analyzer and then the same process happens
when it is being searched as well. Whereas keyword is non anlayzed fields , it is stored in its raw format including whitespaces.
When the search happens it matches exactly the same way it is stored.

Use keyword when you want to search by the literal keyword that is you want an exact match for the whole string. 
For eg the hostname.

Whereas use Text  when you want to seach and retrieve results by the releavance score.

Date values are always stored in UTC. Kibana converts the UTC value to your local browser value and displays it.

There are different types of analyzers.
standard analyzer converts the text into alpha numeric tokens
Elastic search comes in with different analyzers.
The English analyzer removes words that doesnt make any meaning like the word 'THE'.
It converts the words to their base words , like neighbor's will be analyzed as neighbor without the apporstophe.

Simple analyzer splits all the punctuation into a separate word.

Whitespace analyzer keeps every word that is separated

Analyzers are comprised of one tokenizer, zero to many token filters, and zero or many character filters

Custom analyzer syntax

PUT index_name
{
"settings": {
"analysis": {
"analyzer": {
"custom_analyzer_1": { # name your analyzer
"type": "custom", # custom analyzers are always type custom
"tokenizer": "", # tokenizer
"char_filter": [ ... ], # character filters
"filter": [ ... ] # token filters
}
}
}
}
}
