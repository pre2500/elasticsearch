Three main components of an index are aliases , mappings and settings

PUT sample_1
{
  "aliases": {
    "NAME": {}
  },
  "mappings": {
    
  },
  "settings": {
    
  }
}

Difference between keywords and text.Both are string fields.
text is an analyzed fields , it is broken down into multiple tokens using an analyzer and then the same process happens
when it is being searched as well. Whereas keyword is non anlayzed fields , it is stored in its raw format including whitespaces.
When the search happens it matches exactly the same way it is stored.

Use keyword when you want to search by the literal keyword that is you want an exact match for the whole string. 
For eg the hostname.

Whereas use Text  when you want to seach and retrieve results by the releavance score.
