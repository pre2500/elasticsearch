#Setup Hot warm arichtecture depending on the old/recent data
#Hot/warm architecture has become a popular data storage solution for companies with high data retention goals, 
#but they don't have the budget to buy massive amounts of high-speed storage. 
#With hot/warm architecture, we can store our most recent (and typically most relevant) data on faster, 
#more expensive storage and then re-allocate that data to cheaper nodes when it becomes less important. 
#Create NODE ATTRIBUTES as HOT and WARM in your elasticsearch.yml as part of the initial setup.
