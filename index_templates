Whenever you are indexing time-series data or just having to index similar data across many different indexes, 
it can become very tedious to continuously create indexes with the same structure over and over again. 
By using index templates, we can automatically structure all indexes whose name matches a regular expression 
with a specific set of requirements. 

PUT _template/template_name
{
"index_patterns": [ ... ], # patterns to match index names on
"aliases": { ... }, # filtered and/or non-filtered aliases
"mappings": { ... }, # explicit and/or dynamic mappings
"settings": { ... } # index and analysis settings
}
